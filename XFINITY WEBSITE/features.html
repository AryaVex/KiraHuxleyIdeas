                <p><b>Create a easier and faster IVR system and also more pleasant to our customers - so they don't stay on the line listening to music for more then 15 minutes without knowing our programs like ACP or possibilities of troubleshooting on them end with xfinity xfi app or xfinity my account app- apps what we provide to them at no charge- and also more options what they can have if decide to disconnect services or change plans of services or to have billing dispute or to even decide to troubleshoot but only if they want not because automated system decides that is the best for them- offering possibility to decide to our customers matters very much- this way they won't feel that the IVR is against them to reach a human being or demands them what to do,  but actually to offer them possibility to decide for themselves what to do- this option of improvement can be associated with another idea what is on this page- to schedule a call from us and the IVR  to tell them in how much time they will be called back - quite the same procedure what is in OneCti with cold and warm  transfer- when is warm IVR to place the call to the agent and to the customer as well and this way they wont stay on the phone the listening  IVR music and the IVR system talking - For testing this idea we can share it with customers and let them know if they want to participate to the testing program so we can improve our relation and customer service with them. Also this way we show that we want to collaborate with them to improve ourselves from inside out, starting with the intro of our menu when they call 1-800-xfinity.</b></p>

            <p><b>Let's offer  to our customers possibility to have a technician faster to them house by paying each month a extra fee of 5$( is just an example you can do any amount for it- but the idea behind is to have a tech to them house faster at a period of time- and should be taken in consideration as an EMERGENCY tech dispatch) as they pay for SPP plan and can be apply to all types of customers. Instead to charge them one time fee of 100$ we can charge them 5$(just example amount) for a tech fee and when they need a tech and have an emergency needed -what requires a tech to them house- to use that feature, also we can  calculate that fee and let customer know when they will be in position to request again a tech what will be in position to be dispatched  in the next 24 hours(the concept of filling the cookie jar when goes empty). The fee won't offer the right to have a tech to them house each time in the next 24hours, but only after a couple of days/months/ depends on case - if the problem is from us or our customer.</b></p>

Also a list with upcoming jobs in the area  or unplanned outages on what we are working at that moment. This way we show to our customers that we are working and we truly want them to enjoy our services - this idea can be implemented  on the login page on the site along with more information about how they can get help from us even before they login - for example customers what have problems with login to xfinity account  can schedule a call  and we can call them  and this way they can find that we have interest to help them no matter what.</b>

After that they can agree to offer a review about products what we offer as well(this way we capture what is them need and that way we can improve our products  what we offer to them).- This idea can be implemented in the OneCti , and agent can ask customer at the end of the call if he(the customer) will want to review the call.- also this way they will see that  the IVR is helpful and they will start loving it.</b></p>

                                    -20 channels will come with another small fee but again with possibility to bundle with xfinity mobile etc.
                                    - between 50-100 channels cx can get more bundles for different products like 50-100 channels bundle with a subscription for HBO MAX and broadcast fee/ This option can be possible in the begin for customers with tv cable box and after some statistics results to offer the package to customers what use xfinity stream app as well.
                                    After marketing research and all the numbers get increased in the sell section we can offer the bundle with personalized package for tv + mobile service  with unlimited internet and customers can watch them favorite channels on smart tv using the internet from mobile service by using hot spot and also we can help them out with a tutorial how they can achieve this kind of action - options are multiple and ca be divided in many categories and bundles not just tv but with home security as well etc.</B></p>
