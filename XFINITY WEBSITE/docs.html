                <p>Einstein 360 is an amazing tool what we use to share articles with our customer and not only, through it we can troubleshoot and this way we can fix problem to most of our customers. The interactive ITGs can offer more options to troubleshoot, tv problems, dvr, internet, land line services, The entire description what we see over there in the Itg we can use it to inform our cx , and we love that we can inform customer what we do and why we do it , but at times some articles what the ITG offers are not working ,or the  system is still not synchronized with our ACSR  which offer us a very hard time to handle the problem. A more descriptive ITG will help us to stay engaged with our customers and this way we avoid NTT metric as being high. Also we can have smart indicators or reminders what through the process might take a couple of minutes -2-5-9 minutes we can share more information about our products.The smart indicators can be set it up as a reminder with the ''⁉️''' or ⚠️ sign to remind agents that we have opportunity to discover needs and also share more information about our products.  </p>
                <div class="alert alert-success">
                    <i class="fas fa-info"></i>Einstein is a very good tool what allow us to do our job in a proper way, by updating the articles what might be old but still resourceful for us, and our customers,  will make both sides life easier. Also the xfinity App tool what allow us to guide and inform customers where they can see the bill or the account number or even where they can see appointments or to track down the  device what is send it to them , it is a very good tool, even so - some other tools like xfinity stream app should have them spot there as well, along with the various types or menu from the xfinity tv cable boxes. And also this reminder as is set it up over here can be used in Einstein 360 ITGs  to remind agents  different information what hey can do during that troubleshooting time what might take a couple of minutes

                    <p>We need to improve the entire menu of xfinity tv cable boxes  by implementing more options and commands for xfinity voice remote- to design a menu to be more intuitive for our customers and more colorful. Example of voice commands : ''tv off'' and this command will turn off the tv or '' restart tv box'' what will restart the tv  or ''volume 10'' and will set the volume to level 10 or ''play me something'' and will offer to our customer a random channel what might be nice but he never used to watch it. </p>

                    <p>More options to troubleshoot the DVR service and also the recordings and the scheduled recordings in the xfinity my account app or xfinity xfi app and also in the xfinity.com website  for our customers </p>

                        <p>Customers need one single App what has all the apps what we can offer to them , is not necessary to install  5 different apps  for different purpose , we can create an app what can contain all the apps what we offer to them at no charge and they can decide if they want to install that app to use it or not.They will need only one time to login to have access to any app what we offer to them and not placing them to install 5 different apps and they need to login for each one of it.</p>
